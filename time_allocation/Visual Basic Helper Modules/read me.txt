These files contained in this folder can be imported into the VBA Developer environment (Developer Tab)
and used to help you in some of the formatting of the tables that you will output in Stata. 

Most of the files I write take the form of: 
	- I write a sub procedure 
	- I write another sub procedure that calls the first one. 

In this way the procedures that do the actual work are re-usable, you simply pass the procedure the parameters you 
need for the table you are formatting.
